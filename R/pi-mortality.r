#' Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality Surveillance
#'
#' The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) collects and disseminates the Nation's
#' official vital statistics. NCHS collects death certificate data from state vital
#' statistics offices for virtually all deaths occurring in the United States. Pneumonia
#' and influenza (P&I) deaths are identified based on ICD-10
#' multiple cause of death codes.\cr
#' \cr
#' NCHS Mortality Surveillance System data are presented by the week the death occurred
#' at the national, state, and HHS Region levels. Data on the percentage of deaths due
#' to P&I on a national level are released two weeks after the week of death to allow
#' for collection of enough data to produce a stable percentage.  States and HHS regions
#' with less than 20% of the expected total deaths (average number of total deaths
#' reported by week during 2008-2012) will be marked as insufficient data. Collection
#' of complete data is not expected at the time of initial report, and a reliable
#' percentage of deaths due to P&I is not anticipated at the U.S. Department of Health
#' and Human Services region or state level within this two week period.  The data for
#' earlier weeks are continually revised and the proportion of deaths due to P&I may
#' increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received by NCHS.\cr
#' \cr
#' The seasonal baseline of P&I deaths is calculated using a periodic regression model
#' that incorporates a robust regression procedure applied to data from the previous
#' five years. An increase of 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline
#' of P&I deaths is considered the "epidemic threshold," i.e., the point at which
#' the observed proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza was
#' significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the
#' absence of substantial influenza-related mortality. Baselines and thresholds are
#' calculated at the national and regional level and by age group.

#' @md
#' @param coverage_area coverage area for data (national, state or region)
#' @param years a vector of years to retrieve data for (i.e. `2014` for CDC
#'        flu season 2014-2015). CDC has data for this API going back to 2009
#'        and up until the current, active flu season.
#'        Default value (`NULL`) means retrieve **all** years. NOTE: if you
#'        happen to specify a 2-digit season value (i.e. `57` == 2017-2018)
#'        the function is smart enough to retrieve by season ID vs convert that
#'        to a year.
#' @note Queries for "state" and "region" are not necessarily as "instantaneous" as other API endpoints and can near or over 30s retrieval delays.
#'
#' For consistency with \code{\link{ilinet}} columns indicating the week now contain 'week' instead of the previously abbreviation 'wk'.
